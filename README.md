# Portfolio Optimization Project

## Overview
### This project investigates the optimization of a stock portfolio by analyzing historical stock data, calculating returns, and applying various machine learning models. The objective is to develop an optimized investment strategy using tools like Python and Seaborn.

## Dataset
### The dataset consists of historical stock prices for various companies, pulled from Yahoo Finance. The data includes daily closing prices and other relevant financial metrics. It has been cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers, ensuring robust model training.

## Models Used
Monte Carlo Simulation: A computational algorithm that relies on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results, used for portfolio optimization.
CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model): Used to calculate the expected return of an asset based on its beta and expected market return
